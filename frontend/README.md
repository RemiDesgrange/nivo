# Nivo Frontend

This is the frontend of Nivo. This app is build with nuxtjs in `universal` mode. This mean you need a nodejs server to serve the HTML/CSS/JS files.

Dockerfile is meant for production build.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
